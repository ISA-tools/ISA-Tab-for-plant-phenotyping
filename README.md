ISA-Tab-for-plant-phenotyping
=============================
ISA-Tab configuration for plant phenotyping experiments
-------------------------------------------------------

is a selection of MIAPPE attributes mapped to the ISA-Tab format. The most essential attributes that seem common to all phenotyping experiments are contained in the Basic Configuration. It constitutes a scaffolding to construct any phenotypic dataset by adding other relevant attributes from the MIAPPE list. The basic attributes, specific and common to all field or greenhouse experiments are contained in Field Configuration and Greenhouse Configuration, respectively. You can extend them also by adding more relevant columns, but the list of the basic environmental information is already there.
